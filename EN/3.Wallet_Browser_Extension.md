# NEO Wallet Browser Extension
NEO wallet browser extension provides an easy way for browser games or dApps to interact with NEO blockchain without running a NEO full node. It plays the role as a NEO wallet as well as an accessing point to the NEO blockchain to invoke smart contracts. Therefore, developers can focus more on building blockchain games and smart contracts.

Currently, there are several NEO wallet broswer extensions provided by NEO communities. They support APIs or functions that a blockchain game or dApp may requires. 

We have collected useful guidance and instructions for the following NEO wallet browser extensions:
