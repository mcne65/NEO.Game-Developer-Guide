# Smart Contract Development
## 1. Introduction
Smart contracts are a set of commitments defined in digital form, operated on the blockchain to achieve a specific business logic. NEO, as a well-known public blockchain, also supports smart contracts - one of the most important features of blockchain.

Compared to other blockchains, NEO smart contracts have the following characteristics:
* Support of multiple programming languages
* NEO provides a lightweight, low-coupling virtual machine (NEO-VM) for the execution of smart contracts
* For supported languages, NEO provides compilers to translate high-level languages into bytecodes that NEO-VM can execute
* Support [smart contract testing](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/sc/quickstart/test.html)

To learn more about NEO smart contracts and Neo-VM, please refer to [NEO smart contract introduction](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/basic/technology/neocontract.html).

### 1.1 Smart Contract Basics
We provide a tutorial to learn the basics of developing a smart contract, please visit our [NEO smart contract basics](https://github.com/neo-ngd/NEO-Tutorial/blob/master/en/9-smartContract/Smart_Contract_basics.md#neo-smart-contract-101).

### 1.2 NEP-5 Token Standard 
The NEP-5 standard is a token standard which represents a tokenized smart contract. This standard can regulate the token which is issued on the NEO blockchain. A standard method for interacting with these tokens relieves the entire ecosystem from maintaining a definition for basic operations that are required by every Smart Contract that employs a token.

Please refer to [NEP-5 token standard](https://github.com/neo-project/proposals/blob/master/nep-5.mediawiki) for more detail;

### 1.3 NFT Standard
For blockchain games, the NFT standard is one of the essential elements for tracking, trading, and securing digital assets on blockchain. NEO also provides the NFT standard for NEO blockchain game or dApp developers.

For a more detailed introduction to the NFT standard, please refer to [NEO Non-Fungible Token Standard](https://github.com/neo-project/proposals/pull/41/files?short_path=afd2225#diff-afd22253b102da74b022d8c022201ee6).

### 2.1 Set up development env - NEO Blockchain
Developers can choose to setup a private blockchain locally or use NEO TestNet. 

Please see the first chapter: [Setting up NEO Blockchain](./1.Setting_Up_NEO_Blockchain.md).

### 2.2 Smart Contract Development
We currently recommend C# for developing smart contracts, though we also support Java, Python, JavaScript, Golang and plan to support C/C++, and other programming languages.

For different development languages, NEO offers short tutorials to guide you through:
1. Setup NEO smart contract development environment
2. Write smart contract
3. Compile and deploy smart contract to NEO blockchain
4. Interact with smart contract

#### 2.2.1 Smart Contract Implementation & Compilation
Developers can choose the programming language according to their preferences; However, due to the limitations of the smart contracts, there will be some restrictions and unsupported functions in the development process.
* **C#** - Recommended
    * [How to Develop Smart Contract on Windows](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/sc/gettingstarted/introduction.html)
    * [How to Develop Smart Contract on macOS](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/sc/devenv/getting-started-csharp-mac.html)
    * [How to Develop Smart Contract on Ubuntu](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/sc/devenv/getting-started-csharp-ubuntu.html)

* Python
     1. Prerequisites
        * Python 3.6+
        * NEO-Python
        * neo-boa
            \
            neo-boa is the compiler to compile python files to .avm, it is also a python library to provide more NEO blockchain specific functions for smart contracts. More info about neo-boa packages, please click [here](https://neo-boa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/boa/interop/blockchain.html#).

    2. Getting started
        Writing Smart Contracts
        * Developers can use any preferred IDE to write smart contracts in python. 
        * Create a python file
        * Import necessary neo-boa packages in your python smart contract. Here is a simple import example:
            ```python
            from boa.interop.Neo.Runtime import Log, Notify
            from boa.interop.Neo.Storage import Get, Put, GetContext
            from boa.interop.Neo.Runtime import GetTrigger,CheckWitness
            from boa.builtins import concat
            ```
        * Start writing your smart contract. We have provided some samples for learning purposes
            * For simple smart contract samples, please click [here](https://github.com/neo-ngd/NEO-Tutorial/tree/master/neo_docs_neopython_tutorial/smart-contracts)
            * For NEP-5 token sample, please click [here](https://github.com/neo-project/examples-csharp/blob/master/ICO_Template/ICO_Template.cs)

    3. Compiling Smart Contract with NEO-python
        * Once you have finished your python smart contract, you can use neo-python to compile it to .avm file which can be deployed and ran on NEO blockchain. Please click [here](https://github.com/neo-ngd/NEO-Tutorial/blob/master/neo_docs_neopython_tutorial/part2_neopy.md#task-3---smart-contracts) for instructions.
* Java
\
For Java developers, please refer to [How to use Java to write a NEO smart contract](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/sc/devenv/getting-started-java.html) on:
    * how to set up Java development environment 
    * how to implement smart contracts
    * how to compile smart contracts to .avm files

#### 2.2.2 Smart Contract Deployment & Testing
Following the development instructions above, developers should have completed the following steps:
* Set up a NEO blockchain
* Write a smart contract
* Compile smart contract into an .avm file

At this point, Developers can deploy the .avm file to NEO blockchain and then invoke the smart contract for debugging. They can choose to deploy and invoke smart contracts using the following tools:

1. NEO-GUI
\
NEO official documentation describes how to use NEO-GUI for [Deploying and Invoking Smart Contracts](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/sc/deploy/deploy-invoke.html).

2. NEO-python
\
NEO-python is a NEO client developed in Python and covers all the functions required by NEO node, such as: wallets, contracts, and blockchain information queries.
\
For the deployment and invocation of smart contracts using neo-python, please refer toï¼š[How to deploy smart contracts using NEO-python](https://github.com/neo-ngd/NEO-Tutorial/blob/master/neo_docs_neopython_tutorial/part2_neopy.md#task-3---smart-contracts)
