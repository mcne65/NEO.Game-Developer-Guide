# Setting up NEO Blockchain
For blockchain games or DApps development and testing on NEO, we offer the following support:
* **NEO blockchain**
\
Consensus nodes & non-consensus nodes
* **Blockchain explorer**
\
Check block generation status, detailed information for blocks and transactions

The first step is to install a NEO blockchain to support the development and testing. Diverse development environments are provided for game and DApp developers. 

Developers can choose one of the following two options depending on their preference:
1. Setting up NEO PrivateNet
2. Using NEO TestNet

## 1. Setting up NEO PrivateNet
Based on developers' preferences and experience, they can choose one of the following ways to setup NEO PrivateNet.
 ### 1.1 **neo-local** - recommended
Using neo-local, develoeprs can quickly launch NEO PrivateNet and neoScan (blockchain explorer) inside of **Docker** without strong blockchain experience required. It is provided by CoZ, one of the NEO developer communities. 

Windows, Linux & MacOS are supported.

The project is made up of the following services in Docker:

* neo-local-faucet (dev faucet)
* neo-scan-api (block explorer API)
* neo-scan-sync (sync blockchain data for API)
* neo-python (development neo node)
* neo-privatenet (neo consensus nodes)
* postgres (database for neo-scan)

Quick Start:
1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
\
*NOTE*: For windows home edition users, [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) should be used instead.

2. Clone neo-local, or download directly from [here](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-local/archive/master.zip).
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-local.git
    ```

3. How to start neo-local, please visit [neo-local Wiki](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-local/wiki)
\
*NOTE*: For windows home edition users, neoScan can be accessed  with your local docker IP after neo-local starts, similar to [http://192.168.99.100:4000](http://192.168.99.100:4000).
4. Access neo-python in Docker
    ```
    docker exec -it neo-python np-prompt -p -v
    ```
    Now, developers can use neo-python to interact with NEO blockchain. Please refer to here for [how to use neo-python](https://github.com/HandsomeJeff/neo-python-workshop/blob/master/part2_neopy.md#task-2---wallet-operations).

### 1.2. **Set up PrivateNet nodes**
For developers with some blockchain experience, we also provide a more flexible way to create a private NEO blockchain. Developers need to set up local blockchain by running 4 consensus nodes.

Pre-required knowledge:
* Command line
* Principles of operation of blockchain node
* Knowledge of blockchain wallet and token asset

NEO PrivateNet consists of:
* 4 consensus nodes
* [NEO-Cli](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/node/cli/setup.html) : interact with NEO blockchain via command line
* [NEO-Gui](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/node/gui/install.html) : interact with NEO blockchain via user interface

Quick Start:
1. Build a PrivateNet, please click [here](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/network/private-chain/private-chain2.html)
2. Withdraw NEO & GAS in PrivateNet, please click [here](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/network/private-chain/private-chain.html#withdrawing-neo-and-gas)
3. Interact with your PrivateNet using neo-cli, please refer to [how to install neo-cli](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/node/cli/setup.html) and [how to use neo-cli](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/node/cli/cli.html)


## 2. Using TestNet
If developers don't want to build a NEO PrivateNet, it is also possible to connect to NEO TestNet. After connecting to the TestNet, developers can issue digital tokens, deploy and debug games and smart-contracts. Once development and testing are done, they can be deployed to the NEO MainNet.

All TestNet block data and tokens are independent from the MainNet. Both NEO and GAS for the TestNet can be applied for at no cost on the official website.

How to use NEO TestNet：

1. [Join NEO TestNet](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/network/testnet.html)

2. [Apply For TestNet NEO&GAS](https://neo.org/testcoin/apply)

3. [Blockchain Explorers](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/utility/explorers.html)
\
NeoScan、NEL Scan all support NEO TestNet. For more explorers, go to [NEO DApp page](http://ndapp.org/) and click the Explorer tab.

4. Now you can interact with TestNet via NEO-Cli & NEO-Gui
    \
    How to use NEO-Cli and NEO-Gui, please visit [NEO-Cli](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/node/cli/cli.html) and [NEO-Gui](https://docs.neo.org/en-us/node/gui/install.html).
