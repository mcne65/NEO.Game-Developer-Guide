# NEO-SDK
NEO SDK allows developers to quickly build blockchain games or DApps to interact with NEO blockchain, such as creating wallets, sending assets or invoking smart contracts, etc. Developers can also use NEO SDK to develop various NEO-related applications, for example, NEO wallet, Blockchain Explorer, etc.

Considering different development requirements, NEO currently provides various SDKs written in different programming languages, including:
* C#
* Java
* JavaScript/Typescript
